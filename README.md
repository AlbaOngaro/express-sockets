# Chat App
Simple chat app built using [express js](https://expressjs.com/) for the server part and [socket.io](https://socket.io/) to manage socket connections, [Vuejs](https://vuejs.org/) for frontend and [nes.css](https://nostalgic-css.github.io/NES.css/) as css framework.

## How to use
Clone or fork the project and then simply run these commands to watch the magic happen :)

`npm install`

`npm run dev`

If everything goes right the browser should open and you should be able to start chatting around :)

## Folder structure
All the app code is stored in the src folder. 
Those are the two main folders: 
* backend
    * stores the express code to run the server responsible for the socket
* frontend
    * stores the vue js code for the client part and the styles
